As always, I start with the usual process, the scanning phase.
```bash

The page title says `PreviousJs`, so it's pretty clear that everything listed needs to be searched for on the page. So, let's search for "PreviousJs CVE," and we'll find that the vulnerability to exploit is `CVE 2025-29927`. I used curl to exploit it, using the URL and the exploit with the -H parameter.

You should see a URL where you'll need to do the same thing. Then, you'll need to search for a username and password; the username is Jeremy. Next, we'll establish an SSH connection in the console to `ssh jeremy@previous.htb`, enter the password, and you'll automatically be logged in. There you'll find the user flag.
